The full documentation for how to run this script and what it does can be found in codebook.md, but here is a brief primer:

- It requires the dplyr and tidyr libraries to be installed.
- Calling the run\_analysis.R method will provide a tidy dataset that has the mean average measurements by group called for by the instructions. A tidy\_mean\_dataset.txt is also written to disc with the same dataset.
- There are other methods that can be called which return the same dataset in different stages of tidying/analysis. These are explained more in the codebook.

Thanks for grading my assignment!
